## Definitions

### Postulate/Axiom
A statement which is **accepted even without proof**.

### Theorem
A statement that is **proven** is a theorem.

### Undefined Terms
There are three undefined terms: **point**, **line**, and **plane**.

+ A point **denotes a position** in space and has **no dimension**.
+ A line is a **series of points** that **extends in opposite directions without end**.
+ A plane is a **flat surface**.

### Segment
A segment is the part of a line consisting of **two endpoints** and all endpoints between them.

### Ray
A ray is the part of a line consisting of **one endpoint** and **all the points of the line on one side of the endpoint**.

### Opposite Rays
Opposite rays are **two collinear rays** with the **same endpoint**. Opposite rays **always form a line**.

### Betweenness
$B$ is between $A$ and $C$ if:

1. $A$, $B$, and $C$ are different points of the same line, and
2. $AB + BC = AC$

### Midpoint
Given the point B and the segment $\overline{AC}$. $B$ is a midpoint if **$B$ is between $A$ and $C$** and **$AB = BC$**

### Bisector
The **midpoint** of a segment is said to **bisect** the segment. The midpoint **of** any segment, line, plane, or ray which **contains the midpoint** and **does not contain** $\overline{AB}$ is called the bisector of said segment, line, plane, or ray.

### Collinear Points
A set of points is collinear if there is a **line** which **contains all the points of the set**.

### Coplanar Points
A set of points is coplanar if there is a **plane** which **contains all the points of the set**.

### Non-collinear Points
A set of points that **do not lie** on the same line and plane

### Space
A set of all points

### Convex
A set M is called convex if, for every two points P and Q of the set, **the entire segment $\overline{PQ}$ lies in M**.

### Angle
If two rays **have the same end point**, but **do not lie on the same line**, then their union is an **angle**. The two rays are called its **sides**, and their common point is called its **vertex**.

### Interior of an Angle
The set of all points P in the plane of $\angle BAC$ such that:

1. P and B are on the same side of $\overleftrightarrow{AC}$
2. P and C are on the same side of $\overleftrightarrow{AB}$

### Exterior of an Angle
The set of all points of the plane of $\angle BAC$ that lie neither on the angle nor in its interior.

### Acute Angle
An angle that has a measure greater than $0$

## Postulates

### Postulate 1: The Distance Postulate
To **every pair of different points** there **corresponds a unique positive number**.

### Postulate 2: The Ruler Postulate
The points of a line can be placed **in correspondence with the real numbers** in such a way that:

1. To every point of the line there **corresponds exactly one real number**.
2. To every real number there **corresponds exactly one point of the line**; and
3. The **distance between any two points** is the **absolute value** of the **difference of the corresponding numbers**

### Postulate 3: The Ruler Placement Postulate
Given two points P and Q of a line, the coordinate system can be chosen in such a way that the **coordinate of P is zero** and the **coordinate of Q is positive**.

### Postulate 4: The Line Postulate
For **every two points** there is **exactly one line** that **contains both points**.

### Postulate 5
Every plane contains at least three non-collinear points, and space contains at least four non-coplanar points.

### Postulate 6
If two points of a line lie in a plane, then the line lies in the same plane.

### Postulate 7: The Plane Postulate
Any three points lie in at least one plane, and any three non-collinear points lie in exactly one plane.

### Postulate 8
If two different planes intersect, then their intersection is a line.

### Postulate 9: Plane Separation Postulate
Given a line and a plane containing it. The points of the plane that do not lie on the line form two sets such that:

1. Each of the sets are convex
2. If P is in one of the sets and Q is in the other, then the segment $\overline{PQ}$ intersects the line

### Postulate 10: Space Separation Postulate
The points of space that do not lie in a given plane form two sets, such that:

1. Each of the sets are convex
2. If P is in one of the sets and Q is in the other, then the segment $\overline{PQ}$ intersects the line

### Postulate 11: The Angle Measurement Postulate
To every angle $\angle BAC$ there corresponds a real number between 0 and 180.


## Theorems

### Theorem 1
If A, B, and C are three different points of the same line, then exactly one of them is between the other two.

### Theorem 2: The Point Plotting Theorem
Let $\overrightarrow{AB}$ be a ray, and let $x$ be a positive number. There is exactly one point P of $\overrightarrow{AB}$ such that $AP = x$.

### Theorem 3
Every segment has **exactly one midpoint**.

### Theorem 4
If two different lines intersect, their intersection contains only one point.

### Theorem 5
If a line intersects a plane not containing it, then the intersection contains only one point.

### Theorem 6
Given a line and a point not on the line, there is exactly one plane containing both.

### Theorem 7
If two different planes intersect, then their intersection is a line.
